# Machine Learning Algorithms
Some basic exploration and re-creation of machine learning algorithms.

## Description

This project uses simple machine learning algorithms on financial and breast cancer data. There is also code to build the algorithms from scatsch, without the use of libraries.

## Prerequisites

Some of the code requires some, or all of, the following libraries.

```
pandas
quandl
numpy
scikit-learn
pickle
matplotlib
```

* This project is inspired by and built upon fundamentals of [Sentdex](http://sentdex.com/)
* Some of the code uses a breast cancer [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) from the University of Wisconsin
